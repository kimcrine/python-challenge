# python-challenge
Part 1 - PyBank
In this challenge, I was provided with a financial dataset composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". I created a Python script to analyze the data and determine the total amount of months in the dataset and over the entire period find the net total amount of "Profit/Losses", the average of the changes in "Profit/Losses", the greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits. The output prints the financial analysis in the Terminal and exports it as a text file.

Part 2 - PyPoll
In the second challenge, I was given a set of poll data with three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". My Python script analyzes this data by calculating the total number of votes case, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. The output prints the results in the Terminal and exports them as a text file.
